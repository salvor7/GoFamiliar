# Objective
I believe that people should be able to understand, learn from, and even influence the outcomes of the complex algorithms making decisions around them.

My goal here is to take a step in that direction, and make a user interface into the workings of Go player algorithms that allows output as well as input during the running of algorithm

Success would be that a GoFamiliar-aided and Go knowledgeable person can out-perform both a computer Go player and a similarly ranked human player alone.

AlphaGo is an amazing advance, but still an advance perpendicular to the the goal of the Go Familiar.

# Why?
Elon Musks fears of AI are not so much science fiction anymore.

Machines and humans must be melded or cyborgized through better interfaces if we are to avoid the T2 or the Matrix scenarios.

This project is one attempt to play at creating a go playing machine + human meld.
This is similar to Advanced or Freestyle Chess.

# Additional Reasons Why
### Machine Learning
I am using this project as a way to go from knowing about various machine learning techniques to having implemented and used them myself.

### Developer Best Practices
I am also using it as a chance to gain specific developer experience with

    - app writing (using Python)
    - code testing (using pytest)
    - documenting (using docstrings and doctest)
    - version control (using git)
    - code base management
    - development work flows (trying out TDD)
    - continual learning
    - working with mutliple contributors

### Go, Igo, Wei'qui, Baduk
I chose Go because I already know it well.When playing and practicing consistently, my highest rank was 1 dan, though this has slipped due to lack of practice.
I play as salvor7 on most english sites: KGS, DGS, OGS.
If I'm not on one, tell me about it; I'll join it.


# Some ways forward

### Professional Game Library
The library can be used for several machine learning algorithms and visualizations.

    - A Neural network taught and tested on pro games
    - Heat map board overlay of simple, but relevant counts
    - pattern recognition
    - tesuji recognition

### Monte Carlo Tree Search simulator
The planned use of the Monte Carlo simulator is to "siphon off" the random games used in its calculation, save them, and use them in various ways.

    - calculate percentage chance of groups dying continuously
    - discovery "hot areas to play" like tesujis or yose

The real power comes from the human player(s) being able to interact with the MC simulator with search suggestions and being able to test the change or percentage chances around 'test' moves'.


## Project Operating Principles
#### Following a "Work the System" mentality, I'm including a list of principles I work by for this project

    Lavishly use good development practices. Learn these greedily.
    Document everything
    Test everything
    Version control everything
    Seek mentoring to push out of comfort zone
    Be active in the Python community
    Learn new technologies
    But guardedly implement with new technologies
    Teach the technologies I know
